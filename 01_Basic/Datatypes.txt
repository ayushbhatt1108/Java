A data type tells the computer what kind of value a variable can hold and how much memory it needs.

# Datatypes are majorly of two types :

1. Primitive Datatypes

Primitive datatypes are of 4 types mainly
(i) Integer

mainly of 4 types : (a) Int - size = 4 bytes
                    (b) long - size = 8 bytes
                    (c) short - size = 2 bytes
                    (d) byte - size = 1 bytes

(ii) Float

mainly of 2 types : (a) float - size = 4 bytes
                    example ; float c = 56.5f
                    
                    (b) double - size = 8 bytes

(iii) character

                    char - size = 2 bytes

(iv) Boolean

      bool - tells true or false
