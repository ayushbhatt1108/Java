# Java code excutes in JVM which is a part of an OS. Further OS is part of hardware level wise .

# Our application on which Java is running is platform independent while to execute java command
  we need jvm in that application which is platform dependent.

# JVM understands only byte code so to convert our human language code into machine language 
  which is byte code we need to compile our code for which we need a compiler ( javac ).

# JVM can execute 100s or 1000s of files but we need to specify the first file which will contain
  the main method inside it, JVM is going to execute that file first. Then JVM will show us the 
  output by executing all other file one by one.

# Java is object oriented coding language which means everything should be an object and to create
  objects we need a class.

# The moment we compile our code using "javac filename.java" command we get a class file which is 
  the byte code that can only be read by jvm. Now to run the code we need to use "java <class name>"

# Now when we have to run something we use JRE.    JVM is a part of JRE.
 JRE - java runtime environment
 JVM - java virtual machine

# jvm + libraries is a part of jre

# When we install JDK it contains JRE and inside JRE these is JVM. But to run that code of someone
  elses machine only jre and jvm ir required jdk is not required.
