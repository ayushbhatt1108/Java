Logical operators are used to connect two or more boolean expressions and return a true or false 
result.

1. && (Logical AND)
Returns true only if both conditions are true.

int a = 7;
int b = 12;
if (a > 5 && b < 15) {
    System.out.println("Both conditions are true");
}
// Output: Both conditions are true

If even one condition is false, result is false.

2. || (Logical OR)
Returns true if at least one condition is true.

int a = 7;
int b = 20;
if (a > 5 || b < 10) {
    System.out.println("At least one condition is true");
}
// Output: At least one condition is true

3. ! (Logical NOT)
Reverses the result of a condition.

int a = 10;

if (!(a > 15)) {
    System.out.println("a is not greater than 15");
}
// Output: a is not greater than 15
