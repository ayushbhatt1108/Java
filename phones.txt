1. Priorities ( means no compro on this)

- Camera ( to capture memories and do good quality video calls)

- Battery ( har jagah i won't charge my phone na option hoga)

- RAM  and storage ( for better running of phone no hang + jldi storage na fill up ho)

- Updates ( taaki phone lamba chale as regular updates always make phone more smoother and secure also from virus)

2. price range minimum 45k - reason is durability phone lmba chalta hai and its like one time investment taaki years tak chale 1-2 yrs baad lag na krne lage
                            then running for a new phone again is sick and gaali khaane wala kaam 

                            camera isi price range se acha hota meri 4 yrs ki life hai i want to capture as much moments as possible and usi mein quality
                            ka itna issue and video call krunga usme v mai dikhu hi na dhang se toh not good i guess ye sab toh main hai

                            and jo priorities i have uske liye itna price range chahiye hai because saste phone don't provide good battery backup unki display bhi
                            upto the mark nhi hoti + ram chahe zyda v ho but management system is weak so uska koi use ni hai ( jo saste phone mein hota)

                            processor bhi matter krta hai but i don't want any high end processor so yeah 

                            saste phones mein updates ni aate 1-2 saal ke aate max so phone hang krne lagta and for longer updates yani long run of phone
                            we have to invest some moneyy



                            expensive phones have good calling, network, speaker + warranty achi hoti brand value bhi.

3. Now we will see options

1. Samsung s24 plus ( samsung s24 ya baaki nhi kyuki unki battery ghatiya hai )
2. samsung s24 fe
