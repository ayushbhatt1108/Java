A while loop in Java repeatedly executes a block of statements as long as the given condition is true.

public class WhileLoopExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int i = 1;

        while (i <= 5) {
            System.out.println("i = " + i);
            i++; // increment i
        }
    }
}

Output:

i = 1
i = 2
i = 3
i = 4
i = 5

Explanation:

It starts with i = 1.

As long as i <= 5, the loop will print the value of i and then increase i by 1.

When i becomes 6, the condition i <= 5 becomes false, and the loop stops.
