In Java, loops are needed to execute a block of code multiple times without writing it repeatedly. 

Loops make code shorter, more efficient, easier to read, and reduce errors during repetitive tasks like iterating arrays, processing lists, or 
printing sequences.

Summary:

Without Loop                    With Loop
Code is long and messy	        Code is short and clean
Prone to human error	        Reduces error
Hard to maintain	            Easy to maintain
