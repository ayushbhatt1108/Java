# What is github?

GitHub is like a social network and storage space for computer code,it provides a place to store and
organize code files.

# What is the use of GitHub?

It makes it easy for multiple people to work on the same code at the same time. People can make
their own changes, and then those changes can be combined with the main version of the code.

# What is Git?

GitHub uses a system called "Git" to track changes made to code. This means it keeps a history 
of every edit, so you can easily go back to previous versions if needed. This is very important
when multiple people are working on the same project.

# How to clone a repo in vs code

* git init:

Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory. This is the first step in creating a 
new Git project.

* git clone <repository_url>:

Creates a copy of an existing Git repository from a remote URL. This is how you download a project 
from GitHub or another Git hosting service.

* git status:

Displays the status of the working directory and staging area. It shows which files have been
modified, staged, or are untracked.

* git add <file(s)>:

Adds changes in the working file that already exist in github. This prepares the changes for a commit.

* git commit -m "commit message":

Records the staged changes in the repository's history. The "-m" option allows you to add a commit
message directly in the command.
